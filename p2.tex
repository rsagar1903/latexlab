 Combustion, also known as burning, is the basic chemical process of releasing
 energy from a fuel and air mixture. In an internal combustion engine (ICE), the
 ignition and combustion of the fuel occurs within the engine itself. The engine
 then partially converts the energy from the combustion to work. The engine
 consists of a fixed cylinder and a moving piston. The expanding combustion
 gases push the piston, which in turn rotates the crankshaft. Ultimately, through
 a system of gears in the powertrain, this motion drives the vehicleâ€™s wheels
